anything     stigmata   should taken warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close another    four supernatural horror flicks released   clearly worst    suppose should seen coming        blair witch   thoroughly creeped     sixth sense   mildly spooky     stir echoes   had moments   wasn t anything lose sleep    clearly   quality horror summer has slowly been dropping    surprise   stigmata   dullest   horribly executed piece mtv influenced tripe seen long while    no   not really    patricia arquette plays frankie page   hairdresser pittsburgh receives rosary gift globe trotting mother    turns   rosary belonged recently deceased brazilian priest    priest church had been under investigation father andrew kiernan   gabriel byrne   mysterious appearance bleeding statue    father kiernan investigator has made career disproving supposed religious signs   time believes something bleeding statue    investigation soon called off   however   frankie starts exhibiting signs stigmata   person inflicted wounds like jesus christ    father kiernan initially skeptical frankie  story   considering atheist   once witnesses stigmata attacks himself   dedicates himself finding going    eventually begins suspect boss   cardinal houseman   jonathan pryce     concealing something bring down catholic church    turns   dead priest had been working translation   fifth gospel   before were excommunicated    new rupert wainwright music video            mean film   stigmata   sort film starts off ok gets worse    indeed   been good were music video   interesting five minutes    m not sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slow motion   double exposure   extreme close ups   whoaaaaaa             fact has swelled head director hollywood   yes   has been film school    camera trickery interesting little while   eventually   becomes headache inducing    film needed second audio track played dialogue   such     wainwright screaming audience           m ex cellent dir ect      maybe explain why decided start half scenes slow motion shots water dripping reverse   why included random superfluous shots egg frying   ooh   scary        underlying meaning behind camera trickery   didn t    thought safe involved story   here comes double exposure shot patricia arquettes collapsing bed no reason whatsoever    arrrrrrrghhhh            again   superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother   stigmata   had story characters were remotely engaging    though wainwright vanity certainly doesn t help   does seem been given nearly unworkable script    where plot continuity character development need    case point   frankie page character   assume   supposed identify sympathize   aren t given story character   reason like    extent character development seems hard working hairdresser   somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building   kind cute   let start bleeding    fact clearly not brightest bulb drawer doesn t help   either    according frankie page   thing receiving mysterious wounds wrists    clubbing    sure   makes sense    arquette   byrne   pryce old college try   characters dimensional appear sleepwalking    scenes between arquette byrne were probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat   setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable    though frankie page life falling apart before very eyes   still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon    more curiously   seems interested advances    father andrew religious doubt pops suddenly seems more silly dramatic    pryce   may wear curled mustache cackle     ll   pretty     depth cardinal houseman afforded    trust   m not revealing anything telling pryce turns villain    worse   being faced dull characters prospect having annoying camera tricks loud music jammed down throats   contend story starts off direction   veers off another   another   ends being totally incomprehensible      film doesn t bother explain should very simple plot details   does frankie stigmata merely touching rosary    atheist like chosen   since father andrew mentions very devout believers ever received stigmata    actually   m not sure frankie posessed    supposedly   stigmata occurs posessed holy spirit   film later has being posessed dead priest   later evil spirit           answer question   course   very simple   possessing entity each scene determined whichever effects flashy camera mr   wainwright wants time    furthermore   ending ridiculously neat little wrap   filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe against catholic church    research gospel st   thomas   ll find not being suppressed church   film seems claim     readily available local library    nothing catholics need worry   though       stigmata   religion off base t confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church    wanted portray catholic priests mobsters   should gone equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns   been far more interesting    m not catholic   fact   don  t care much catholic church   cartoonish misrepresentation film should not considered realistic means    rare film fails many levels   stigmata   does     not thought provoking   though like   definitely not scary   though pretends    m not sure why tried pass off horror film   absolutely nothing scary story    maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight whatsoever    initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens        like many films mtv generation   suffers overkill    much overdone   stigmata     eventually has no effect audience   leaving pick film   many   flaws    m still trying figure why quotation take gospel st   thomas earth shattering    finally hear   saying sounds like something every five old learns sunday school   means flash   whole film really much ado nothing    dog days summer usually produce monstrous dog     stigmata
