dreamed seeing     hoping film turn element useful starting point movie    does quite    characters smart   know what not    character seems little cliched general   george dzundza     yet   remains logical everything does    obvious flaws course   mostly lying technical aspects    special effects mediocre   plain bad    part   remain believable   noticed homage alien series mothers gave birth alien children        realistic ones usually goriest   ranging people being torn open   someone head being blown off    however   plot elements may elicit laughs audience   including menage troi necessary    many people dislike species series is excuse sex   nudity   gory violence    however   tend disagree    were alien films      alien species ever did earth   sole purpose destroy   wouldn t mate quickly possible many people possible    gripe during scene where patrick goes searching mate grocery store    didn t realize aliens were picky choosing women mate   assume part human side looking beautiful      acting quite good kind film    vast improvement film   least    acting key element film   bad   lowered itself camp   good   asked comparison films like aliens    okay   isn t good    george dzundza probably obvious mistake casting   top impersonation general makes annoying distracting    natasha henstridge limited time around   usually enclosed cage    however   does manage very impressive performance aspect hindering talent    oh yeah   quite fun plain watch    marg helgenberger immensely better time around   performance probably best film    michael madsen so   isn t annoying   soon becomes rather appealing   nice cynic personality      james cromwell has small part   makes much better been more incapable actor      film james cromwell dramatically increases likeability    mykelti williamson gives enjoyable performance   gives film more down earth feel      course   justin lazard    lazard has far been ridiculed performance   effective    sure   wooden   isn t character like    moment touches glass separating henstridge extremely done   due couple acting    species ii rated r strong sexuality   sci fi violence gore language    definitely r rated film young kids should not    more likely   probably nightmares never sex rest lives    hell   don t know    sure critically lambasted film turns surprise film    probably won t another film where expecting little got much quite while    director peter medak has crafted very suspenseful   sometimes very scary movie mediocre series    medak has mastered wonderful   jump      moments   has probably second scariest moment ever seen film   scream still has      strong acting   smart dialogue   intelligent plotting   sure handed director   species ii exactly films should   entertaining
