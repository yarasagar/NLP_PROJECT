perhaps plots tend very similar each   many cases   nonexistant    fact   many wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely until few minutes before end      matter   might jackie chan films more modern settings   armour god   rumble bronx   etc     tend more spectacular stunts   often involving large motor vehicles large explosions   whereas period pieces simply martial arts    having said   must turn right around drunken master ii remarkable exception above   better martial arts films ve seen   quite enjoyed    surprised         drunken master ii young man named wong fei hong   played

jackie chan genius    primary martial arts   style   featured film drunken boxing   form kung fu attempts draw adversary off guard making seem like fellow using drunk    further   purposes film least   drunken boxers fight better actually   intoxicated        fine line between drunk enough drunk stupor    under normal circumstances   idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively incredibly might seem rather stupid   jackie pulls off flair    kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper   ll fights  especially big climactic fight end  themselves make movie worth watching    another thing drunken master ii has going stunt    without motor vehicles     not counting train     remarkable stunts film    among things   jackie dives off balcony table crawls across hot coals   not once    least  twice   count outtake shown during credits         quicktime movies stunts found through www movie database      unlike american films
