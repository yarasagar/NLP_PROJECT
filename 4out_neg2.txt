seemed like perfect concept    better farrelly brothers   famous writing directing comedies offensive subject matter   make movie guy split personality    exactly sort thing brothers relish   poking fun something serious   case mental illness     throwing care wind laugh    jim carrey signed too    better    national alliance mentally ill helped levying complaints against brothers  new film before opening   claiming misrepresenting condition split personality   labeling incorrectly   schizophrenia     forth    such protest seemed like sort thing   course   add more fuel farrelly brothers  fire   proving people couldn t take joke   farrellys helping more enlightened viewers yet another dose brilliantly subversive comedy    yes   seemed perfect   thing went wrong   movie isn t funny    not lack trying    farrellys utilize     myself   irene   high concept premise ever   carrey plays charlie baileygaites   man being dumped wife midget limo driver   decides bury aggressive feelings deep down inside never release      course   means neighbors exploit entirely too forgiving nature   making job rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult    soon enough   charlie repressed aggression manifests itself second   independent personality named hank   deep voiced   boorish ogre unafraid taking assertive actions predecessor had been unable muster    guy isn t above crashing car through wall barber shop been insulted   holding little girl head underwater refused stop jump roping street    things start getting lost complicated plot farrellys ever attempted   film runs off tracks    suggested isn t problem   farrelly brothers  brand humor doesn t require plot    re wrong   course   plot greatly instrumental building kind rollicking comic energy infused farrellys  last effort      something mary            outside providence   technically earlier project      brothers  earlier film wasn t funny merely contained outrageous gags   despite newsmagazine articles believe     rather outrageous gags were entirely unexpected      mary     farrellys managed several times pull off neat sleight hand trick   thinking story going   reveal real direction delightfully surprising fashion         myself   irene     contrast   seems been made folks looked   mary   saw surface grossness   missing subtle machinations really made    having been produced same guys made   mary       irene   seems like bigger disappointment    brothers pile offensive humor   taking shots race   midgets   albinos   mental illness   manner bathroom jokes    haven t make fresh     myself

predictable       charlie irene fall love    yeah   too      farrellys introduce scores different characters   none ever manage anything haven t already expected   no matter outrageous actions might    compared curveballs farrellys used throwing   stuff almost entirely soft tossed   presenting obvious problem   gross humor loses shock value   no longer funny   merely gross    jokes milked over until effectiveness runs dry    take   example   subplot involving charlie three black sons   anthony anderson   mongo brownlee   jerod mixon      incongruity funny while   three burly black men discussing higher math ghetto language white bread carrey mouthing said language entirely too pleasant smile face    end film   re still doing same schitck hasn t been elevated another   funnier level   hasn t been dropped either    too bad   ceases amusing halfway through         myself   irene   reeks wasted opportunities    ought more focus people react charlie new personality   charlie deals consequences hank actions    doesn t really happen nearly every supporting character learns charlie condition early   don t opportunity surprised    film throws looks like patented farrelly curve scene towards midway point   involving albino companion charlie irene pick called   appropriately     whitey       script doesn t anywhere   instead leaving thread twisting wind before awkwardly tying during climax    jim carrey gifted comedian   both physically vocally   left nothing much here except contort himself manner similar steve martin        great showcase flexibility split second role shifting   none terribly funny    carrey doesn t pull stunts don t expect pull   farrellys  script doesn t anything else pull   situations must perform role shifting aren t set meaningful    perhaps carrey take solace fact supporting actors fare no better    zellweger irene not strong female lead mary   mary   may been part adolescent fantasy   intelligent strong willed    irene nothing particular   film never makes clear whether ditzy   clever   neither    such   gives nothing latch onto   sane   person film    chris cooper stuck playing exactly note corrupt fbi agent   character entirely too straight laced movie like      like others   does absolutely nothing unexpected    viewing shapeless mess     myself   irene   eventually dissolved   stuck wondering whether not farrellys had outsmarted themselves    maybe kind comedy long until audiences wise stop being shocked    don t believe    good filmmakers find ways surprising audiences people grown attuned style    farrellys indeed good   smart filmmakers   still     ll rebound fine    happens   though   ll still consider     myself   irene   high caliber misfire
