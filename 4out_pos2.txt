enhance movie whole    nowhere near intrusive films ve been getting throughout    missteps siege found couple excesses takes    example   pretty clear throughout film meant more thriller action flick    unfortunately   scene where army cuts loose against arab immigrants blatant display firepower explosions   obviously meant sole purpose being eye catching    middle city   against no real opposition

getting through closing door looked like apted thought filming sort high brow art movie    almost seemed like didn t know doing    were brief scenes really shouldn t take away otherwise solid job apted did directing    ever seen bond film   won t shocked learn plot has never been strong suit    world not enough no exception    time yet another villain bond has stop good world     matches wits

biggest disappointment robert carlyle character    while carlyle did fine job material had   character never worked    producers tried very hard add more complexity character   never quite got off
