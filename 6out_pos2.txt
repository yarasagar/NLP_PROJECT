producer   promised had proved themselves projects    micheal eisner executives arrived disney animation studio   animators were struggling complete black cauldron    time   things had gone really rocky animation department    many studio old men had retired died    therefore   animators suffered hard time making film    originally budgeted  million   costs raised  million constant changes everything   finally released june       black cauldron greeted praising reviews critics   somehow film flopped    film rated pg film   although  disneyfied  lloyd alexander chronicles prydain   film based     much more scarier darker disney previous efforts   such rescuers fox hound   probably why many people considered too scary stayed away    addition   critics rejected having  no heart   unmemorable    compared disney animated features    whatever real reason   black cauldron financial disaster   grossing  million    failure film grounded studio animation department   exiled animation team annex buildings nearby glendale   seemed like animated features no longer become part studio reputation    next disney animated features   great mouse detective oliver company   although little more lighthearted black cauldron   didn t much better   although oliver company grossed much more black cauldron great mouse detective      little mermaid did studio regain reputation successful animated features    black cauldron   rereleased cities temporary time under title taran magic cauldron    finally   studio locked film film vault denied ever released      might ask yourself   black cauldron really such bad movie    people had seen film didn t    fact   many people had calls buena vista home video requesting film   course   denied    while   seemed like black cauldron never released video   until september    disney released black cauldron video united kingdom    few people imported video england converted ntsc   including   those hadn t seen film yet   included here     got quite treat    people had bootleg copies black cauldron noticed scene where horned king raises army deathless warriors    seconds ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed film u rating   uk   u rating means universal   suitable ages   kinda like own version g      somewhere online   team diehard black cauldron fans signed petition said    bring black cauldron         disney finally

cauldron     released pg rated version    still   finally released   reaction mixed    felt indeed cut   felt wasn t    where minor criticisms seemed laughable   since film absent thirteen years finally available    myself   saw movie time   converted ntsc video     didn t expect much    fact   had heard many mediocre things   didn t film ever such good film    much surprise   saw few minutes film   asking myself     same film everyone saw    flopped box office    critics filmgoers alike called   bad movie      doesn t seem like above    instead   classic own right    film has wonderful cast characters    taran   grant bardsley     assistant pig keeper rather warrior pig keeper   story hero    critics said taran not likeable   opposite true    brave   loyal   eventually learns lesson friendship later    likeable character here    not likeable character film    gurgi   john biner     lovable little   uh   thing remains loyal taran   though don t quite hit off    another likeable

story itself adventurous   quest involving mystical pig   hen wen   black cauldron itself   army deathless ones everything   hooking opening spectacular finale    elmer bernstein music tells story perfectly   dark   yet calming manner    animation itself surprisingly good considering film created darkest time studios    though occasional effects not quite good   like ground opening black cauldron rises earth   animation overall top notch    overall   film entertaining endeavor    fans unfamiliar lloyd alexander chronicles prydain kick   except young kids    extremely scary scenes more darker disney films   although consider stampede sequence lion king frollo observing esmeralda fires hell hunchback notre dame scary     main reason why film rated pg    fans familiar lloyd alexander series recognize differences between novel movie    though doesn t ingredients true disney film   film classic own right   deserves far better chance has been given    better chance has finally

cinema has been around hundred years      not job recap century every time talk new film   like m beginning understand art more watch more films before time    recently   ve seen films hitchcock   capra   fellini   godard   kurosawa   chaplin   lang   many others       those men were talented artists   films reflect genius      likely remembered              quite while      like film   too      yes   disaster slash action movie      true   budget lot more money ll ever lifetime      not doubt mind reason conceived make lot money      fact   bet producers armageddon worked towards lousy film   had thought ve been more profitable    certainly don t care intentions were   michael bay   rock   such skilled director doubt ever make film difficult sit through    course   skillful direction doesn t complete package   rest armageddon manages keep everything together    story thought   perfectly paced provide abundance action sequences never feel place     acting terrific   script sharp         characters    yes   read right    armageddon actually has characters care    don t like film   problem genre itself   armageddon good film like    ve seen deep impact   know basic framework story

incidental   really   story cohesive remotely believable   people too wrapped explosions seconds  thought actually happens    bay congratulate case   has made film entertaining visually sharp doubt director done better    budget went cameras alone   bay films every action sequence thirty forty different angles    take spectacular opening scene   instance   meteor shower obliterates new york    meteor flies sky crashes building   sends fireballs erupting air cars spinning like tops upon cars    action itself might take five seconds real life   bay edits quickly same scene six different ways    like quick edit style   abrasive exhausting watch    very loud   obnoxiously noisy times    fun obnoxious sometimes    special effects film put every  blockbuster shame    deep impact   visually   has absolutely nothing armageddon   offer comparison between quality film godzilla simply laughable    special effects very important film like   re not good   image not convincing   film doesn t    everything here looks bright explosive    little meteors bursting through skyscrapers   shots earth through jutting rocks ominously approaching asteroid    effects don t totally real still pleasure behold   credit everyone involved creating blockbuster nice looking actually qualifies art    course   add little more above average light show   didn t feeling bay cares much characters does action    film half hours long   not spent submerged numbing action    much film dedicated developing various characters  subplots    won t suggest complex characters   problems real   emotions aren t put forth sentimental overbearing    fact   three four scenes here had pretty choked   lot more deep impact   banking feel good parts story    bruce willis terrific   m glad bigger life again   recent turns films like mercury rising been very disappointing      tyler affleck great together   make convincing couple    scenes between comfortable level    patton   magnificent actor   thankfully not wasted here   minor subplot revolving around ex wife son very moving    comic relief buscemi peter stormare   plays crazy russian astronaut   nifty   keeps film lively funny    wasn t challenged real hard while watching armageddon   don t mind too much    film doesn t insult intelligence    pitched perfectly entertain   really wants    not mindless escapist   crafted cinema    might been created wrong reasons   men like michael bay respect showing interested making something good   spite producers budget    m not saying films like risky moves    saying armageddon big   loud   expensive motion picture reminds art often comes strangest forms    no secret motion picture industry relationship between script actors involved often makes breaks movie box office    poorly written script bested superb acting corps   written piece mangled group amateurs    directing latest action comedy   director brett ratner   money talks   takes relatively mediocre piece standup comedy turns funny buddy cop movie    addition   rush hour serves class example directing movie conservative attitude   feature sure draw crowds types    lead names share equal screen time here   mostly spend together    jackie chan   completely american production   makes impressive debut mixing dialogue martial arts    martial arts flick few weeks ago   knock off   stands no chance against content    chan manages make every fight scene exude grace poise   no doubt large percentage video sales movie viewers couldn t believe eyes time    chris tucker   opposite side   relates hilarious comedic approach smoothes rough edges chan performance    works perfectly script   quite likely lent scribe jim kouf hand lines    almost essential action genre   plot nonexistent    re quickly introduced detective james

 rattner does fine job going extra mile movie move step   doesn t quite reach top tier action comedies like last grosse pointe blank    moments where plot strays too far off straight line sticks almost exclusively   not comedic interactions between tucker chan   might major drawback      supporting characters almost entirely along ride   others simply menacing    however   none gives standoffish performance mostly mesh background    almost every member cast displays reservation point another   whether tucker toned down routine chan tight rein action sequences   contributes greatly
