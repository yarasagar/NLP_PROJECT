jericho swears protect against devil faction priests looking kill    many problems film hard know where begin   starting concept    casting arnold role like mistake begin    schwarzenegger persona   not actor   putting role contradicts usual strong personality bad idea    arnold has neither dramatic range nor speaking ability pull off character tormented conflicting emotions    words   trying dimension mistake    harrison ford   mel gibson   bruce willis played role   ve played noble flawed heroes     not schwarzenegger    several scenes attempt establish jericho character   has contemplating suicide   another crying loss wife daughter   devil tries tempt revealing christine location offering old life    none scenes really   arnie isn t task    filmmakers been better off making jericho strong   confident character   like terminator   example     likes schwarzenegger has excelled before    isn t believable arnold plays    supporting cast tries hardest   gabriel byrne makes impact    prince darkness   suave confident    acts like expect devil act    problem script has doing things make no sense   more later   undermines powerful villain    byrne performs arnold every scene together   including aforementioned temptation bit     problematic causes audience start doing unthinkable   root devil    byrne speech bible being   overrated   actually starts make sense   mainly arnold attempts refuting   mostly    tis not      variety   feeble best    problem   arnold has win   end   nobody really cares    kevin pollack plays jericho security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides   like bad action movie sidekicks   disappears hour    robin tunney isn t given much except scared    fact   supporting players good actors   none   save byrne   given anything interesting    performances aside   really hard enjoy film no matter starred    being action blockbuster   no surprise worst thing script   starts off totally confusing   explained   not much     utterly ridiculous    why devil coming new eve       exactly  years devil   isn t    turns    nutty priest accidentally read upside down   real    add  beginning   ve got     don t buy explanation

isn t explained    why satan kill everyone passes street   comes snuffing drunk ex cop   powerless    impervious kind bullet    t control jericho christine    did those gregorian monks deal time zones prophecies    clumsy attempt joke made   never actually explained    usually   sort thing wouldn t matter schwarzenegger flick   mean   don t started time paradoxes offered terminator movies     time plot inconsistencies stand more usual action rarely exciting    several predictable horror film clich   present   end days     complete old   black cat hiding cabinet   bit   not ever find cat doing    gets formulaic possible those uninterested being scared close eyes precise moment   boo      predictions rarely wrong    more grandiose action sequences utterly charmless   partially don t care characters   due script pathetic attempts characterization setup       too   don t make sense    scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady    good few chuckles   not much else    supposedly re believe has super strength virtue being controlled satan   script never sets   scene merely silly    none terribly exciting   action sequences badly framed often hard tell why happening place   not mention re edited full incomprehensible mtv quick cut style    had scratching head   rather saying     wow   cool         end days   not silly confusing   distinctly unpleasant watch    devil apparently doesn t operate more subtle   ll convince people kill each fashion outlined bible   instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight    doesn t make awfully predictable sort   means not single scene   end days   goes without unnecessarily graphic violence   odd kinky sexual encounter   yet another bit had scratching head      violence supposed shocking   not good idea throw much movie audience goes numb    scenes aren t connected through reasonable means   lot time   stuff gets blown   people killed   had no idea why    reasons    hell reasons    let

happening hack peter hyams here       end days   might had camp value   didn t top itself off overly pious ending nobody going buy    movie going serious   filmmakers should decent script    going campy   arnold shouldn t taking himself damn seriously   didn t actually put cross   did       character shouldn t such sad sack    stands     end days   bad movie   awfully gloomy
