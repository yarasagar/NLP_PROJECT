star wars   episode    phantom menace       review matt pusateri  few movies evoke nostalgia   enthusiasm   affection like george lucas   classic   star wars    original blockbuster film sequels not evoked wonder passion generation filmgoers   has deeply entrenched itself american pop culture    arguably   more americans today explain   force     jedi   budget deficit serb     years release original    years since third film   return jedi   new star wars film withstand weight incomparable expectations anticipation    new storyline new cast characters possibly compete legends trilogy   luke   han solo   darth vader  cultural icons    against challenge   fourth star wars film   episode   phantom menace hit screens last week    despite early critical reviews major media   film neither flop nor disappointment    while phantom menace certainly not finest film series   nonetheless engaging   exciting   visually breathtaking    worthy sequel   er   prequel   original star wars films    phantom menace takes place decades before setting original films    film opens   obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor     wise old master introduced luke force original star wars   young jedi apprentice   still learning fellow jedi instructor   qui gon jinn   liam neeson      republic government has sent jedi settle trade dispute has developed blockade planet naboo shifty trade federation    jedi

blockade invasion naboo   sends lethal apprentice   darth maul   find capture queen amidala    while amidala jedi fight save planet   soon deal deadly relentless darth maul    plot sounds bit complicated      phantom menace not introduces earlier generation characters immediate crisis   sets foundation events eventually lead fall republic   demise jedi knights   anakin turn evil   rise dark empire original trilogy    complexity not overwhelming    story moves quickly   drawback being many questions   predictably   remain unanswered end film   setting stage next episode    reasons film story seems hazy not too confusing   too unfocused    unclear whose story phantom menace    original trilogy   movies were clearly luke story   stories centering around growth farmboy rebel hero jedi knight    unclear whether new film anakin story obi wan    trilogy centered anakin   shaky foundation    lloyd   like many child actors   lacks subtle acting skills adult performers   result   character seems shallow unimpressive    screen   nothing suggests dark side lurking underneath little boy face   matter   presence make seem special qui gon willing believe        rest cast does fine   though often iffy dialogue lucas    neeson perfect aging jedi knight    mcgregor cast obi wan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility    portman fits role young queen   lines were often very formal   giving little room character much personality    biggest problem phantom menace not plot characters   interaction between    individually   characters new film no less developed those original star wars   storyline not more confusing previous films series    unlike previous trilogy   lucas doesn t good job playing characters off another    star wars   were immediate contrasts memorable exchanges between luke han   han obi wan   leia luke    ensemble played off each immediately showed distinct attitudes personalities    sequence where luke   han   chewbacca attempt rescue leia cell death star   audience learns lot four characters ways react immediate problems each    no comparable sequence phantom menace flesh characters relationships each    individually   interesting characters clear motivations interests   lucas develops little chemistry tension between    perhaps glaring weakness film   probably reason has disappointed many reviewers    despite need richer dialogue stronger character interaction   film still very engaging    many wonderful elements lucas  previous films make phantom menace both memorable entertaining      course   remarkably rich imaginative universe lucas creates    characters visit magical underwater cities   evade dinosaur sized sea monsters   fight battle droids menacing   destroyers   venetian looking planet naboo   watch spectacular event   part roman chariot race   part nascar circuit   arid desert planet tatooine   head corsucant   gothic urban capital republic home galactic senate jedi council    each location
