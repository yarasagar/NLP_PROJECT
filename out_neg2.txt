seemed like perfect concept    better farrelly brothers   famous writing directing comedies offensive subject matter   make movie guy split personality    exactly sort thing brothers relish   poking

before opening   claiming misrepresenting condition split personality   labeling incorrectly   schizophrenia     forth    such protest seemed like sort thing   course   add more fuel farrelly brothers  fire   proving people couldn t take joke   farrellys helping more enlightened viewers yet another dose brilliantly subversive comedy    yes   seemed perfect   thing went wrong   movie isn t funny    not lack trying    farrellys utilize     myself   irene   high concept premise ever   carrey plays charlie baileygaites   man being dumped wife midget limo driver   decides bury aggressive feelings deep down inside never release      course   means neighbors exploit entirely too forgiving nature   making job rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult    soon enough   charlie repressed aggression manifests itself second   independent personality named hank   deep voiced   boorish ogre unafraid taking assertive actions predecessor had been unable muster    guy isn t above crashing car through wall barber shop been insulted   holding little girl head underwater refused stop jump roping street    things start getting lost complicated plot farrellys ever attempted   film runs off tracks    suggested isn t problem   farrelly brothers  brand humor doesn t require plot    re wrong   course   plot greatly instrumental building kind rollicking comic energy infused farrellys  last effort      something mary            outside providence   technically earlier project      brothers  earlier film wasn t funny merely contained outrageous gags   despite newsmagazine articles believe     rather outrageous gags were entirely unexpected      mary     farrellys managed several times pull off neat sleight hand trick   thinking story going   reveal real direction delightfully surprising fashion         myself   irene     contrast   seems been made folks looked   mary   saw surface grossness   missing subtle machinations really made    having been produced same guys made   mary       irene   seems like bigger disappointment    brothers pile offensive humor   taking shots race   midgets   albinos   mental illness   manner bathroom jokes    haven t make fresh     myself

predictable       charlie irene fall love    yeah   too      farrellys introduce scores different characters   none ever manage anything haven t already expected   no matter outrageous actions might    compared curveballs farrellys used throwing   stuff almost entirely soft tossed   presenting obvious problem   gross humor loses shock value   no longer funny   merely gross    jokes milked over until effectiveness runs dry    take   example   subplot involving charlie three black sons   anthony anderson   mongo brownlee   jerod mixon      incongruity funny while   three burly black men discussing higher math ghetto language white bread carrey mouthing said language entirely too pleasant smile face    end film   re still doing same schitck hasn t been elevated another   funnier level   hasn t been dropped either    too bad   ceases amusing halfway through         myself   irene   reeks wasted opportunities    ought more focus people react charlie new personality   charlie deals consequences hank actions    doesn t really happen nearly every supporting character learns charlie condition early   don t opportunity surprised    film throws looks like patented farrelly curve scene towards midway point   involving albino companion charlie irene pick called   appropriately     whitey       script doesn t anywhere   instead leaving thread twisting wind before awkwardly tying during climax    jim carrey gifted comedian   both physically vocally   left nothing much here except contort himself manner similar steve martin        great showcase flexibility split second role shifting   none terribly funny    carrey doesn t pull stunts don t expect pull   farrellys  script doesn t anything else pull   situations must perform role shifting aren t set meaningful    perhaps carrey take solace fact supporting actors fare no better    zellweger irene not strong female lead mary   mary   may been part adolescent fantasy   intelligent strong willed    irene nothing particular   film never makes clear whether ditzy   clever   neither    such   gives nothing latch onto   sane   person film    chris cooper stuck playing exactly note corrupt fbi agent   character entirely too straight laced movie like      like others   does absolutely nothing unexpected    viewing shapeless mess     myself   irene   eventually dissolved   stuck wondering whether not farrellys had outsmarted themselves    maybe kind comedy long until audiences wise stop being shocked    don t believe    good filmmakers find ways surprising audiences people grown attuned style    farrellys indeed good   smart filmmakers   still     ll rebound fine    happens   though   ll still consider     myself   irene   high caliber misfire

making jericho strong   confident character   like terminator   example     likes schwarzenegger has excelled before    isn t believable arnold plays    supporting cast tries hardest   gabriel byrne makes impact    prince darkness   suave confident    acts like expect devil act    problem script has doing things make no sense   more later   undermines powerful villain    byrne performs arnold

behind camera trickery   didn t    thought safe involved story   here comes double exposure shot patricia arquettes collapsing bed no reason whatsoever    arrrrrrrghhhh            again   superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother   stigmata   had story characters were remotely engaging    though wainwright vanity certainly doesn t help   does seem been given nearly unworkable script    where plot continuity character development need    case point   frankie page character   assume   supposed identify sympathize   aren t given story character   reason like    extent character development seems hard working hairdresser   somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building   kind cute   let start bleeding    fact clearly not brightest bulb drawer doesn t help   either    according frankie page   thing receiving mysterious wounds wrists    clubbing    sure   makes sense    arquette   byrne   pryce old college try   characters dimensional appear sleepwalking    scenes between arquette byrne were probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat   setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable    though frankie page life falling apart before very eyes   still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon    more curiously   seems interested advances    father andrew religious doubt pops suddenly seems more silly dramatic    pryce   may wear curled mustache cackle     ll   pretty     depth cardinal houseman afforded    trust   m not revealing anything telling pryce turns villain    worse   being faced dull characters prospect having annoying camera tricks loud music jammed down throats   contend story starts off direction   veers off another   another   ends being totally incomprehensible      film doesn t bother explain should very simple plot details   does frankie stigmata merely touching rosary    atheist like chosen   since father andrew mentions very devout believers ever received stigmata    actually   m not sure frankie posessed    supposedly   stigmata occurs posessed holy spirit   film later has being posessed dead priest   later evil spirit           answer question   course   very simple   possessing entity each scene determined whichever effects flashy camera mr   wainwright wants time    furthermore   ending ridiculously neat little wrap   filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe against catholic church    research gospel st   thomas   ll find not being suppressed church   film seems claim     readily available local library    nothing catholics need worry   though       stigmata   religion off base t confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church    wanted portray catholic priests mobsters   should gone equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns   been far more interesting    m not catholic   fact   don  t care much catholic church   cartoonish misrepresentation film should not considered realistic means    rare film fails many levels   stigmata   does     not thought provoking   though like   definitely not scary   though pretends    m not sure why tried pass off horror film   absolutely nothing scary story    maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight whatsoever    initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens        like many films mtv generation   suffers overkill    much overdone   stigmata     eventually has no effect audience   leaving pick film   many   flaws    m still trying figure why quotation take gospel st   thomas earth shattering    finally hear   saying sounds like something every five old learns sunday school   means flash   whole film really much ado nothing    dog days summer usually produce monstrous dog     stigmata
