jackie chan genius    primary martial arts   style   featured film drunken boxing   form kung fu attempts draw adversary off guard making seem like fellow using drunk    further   purposes film least   drunken boxers fight better actually   intoxicated        fine line between drunk enough drunk stupor    under normal circumstances   idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively incredibly might seem rather stupid   jackie pulls off flair    kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper   ll fights  especially big climactic fight end

getting through closing door looked like apted thought filming sort high brow art movie    almost seemed like didn t know doing    were brief scenes really shouldn t take away otherwise solid job

incidental   really   story cohesive remotely believable   people too wrapped explosions seconds  thought actually happens    bay congratulate case   has made film entertaining visually sharp doubt director done better    budget went cameras alone   bay films every action sequence thirty forty different angles    take spectacular opening scene   instance   meteor shower obliterates new york    meteor flies sky crashes building   sends fireballs erupting air cars spinning like tops upon cars    action itself might take five seconds real life   bay edits quickly same scene six different ways    like quick edit style   abrasive exhausting watch    very loud   obnoxiously noisy times    fun obnoxious sometimes    special effects film put every  blockbuster shame    deep impact   visually   has absolutely nothing armageddon   offer comparison between quality film godzilla simply laughable    special effects very important film like   re not good   image not convincing   film doesn t    everything here looks bright explosive    little meteors bursting through skyscrapers   shots earth through jutting rocks ominously approaching asteroid    effects don t totally real still pleasure behold   credit everyone involved creating blockbuster nice looking actually qualifies art    course   add little more above average light show   didn t feeling bay cares much characters does action    film half hours long   not spent submerged numbing action    much film dedicated developing various characters  subplots    won t suggest complex characters   problems real   emotions aren t put forth sentimental overbearing    fact   three four scenes here had pretty choked   lot more deep impact   banking feel good parts story    bruce willis terrific   m glad bigger life again   recent

wasted here   minor subplot revolving around ex wife son very moving    comic relief buscemi peter stormare   plays crazy russian astronaut   nifty   keeps film lively funny    wasn t challenged real hard while watching armageddon   don t mind too much    film doesn t insult intelligence    pitched perfectly entertain   really wants    not mindless escapist   crafted cinema    might been created wrong reasons   men like michael bay respect showing interested making something good   spite producers budget    m not saying films like risky moves    saying armageddon big   loud   expensive motion

biggest cliches serial killer film believable    know   where detective looks wall pictures police information   suddenly spots clue reveals killer    sure   been used over   reason   always fun watch

don t quite story worked novel form    makes kiss girls good acting technical visual impressiveness    cinematography   aaron schneider   reminiscient seven   sometimes felt many shots were trying too

terrific   editing makes scene    chaotic mtv type cutting gives audience sense confusion unawareness   exactly judd character experiencing    however   best aspect kiss girls actors    morgan freeman today powerful believable actors    detective cross very good character   although similar character seven    freeman powerful presence   carries half film himself    half carried ashley judd   today promising dramatic actresses    fact   performance better freeman   possible    character more original freeman   handles wonderfully    finally female character movie like does more scream

  mediocre second half   kiss girls somehow manages thoroughly entertain    fact   had urge again performances    cinematography adds lot mood already creepy tone   script usually smart    clearly

dark empire original trilogy    complexity not overwhelming    story moves quickly   drawback being many questions   predictably   remain unanswered end film   setting stage next episode    reasons film story seems hazy not too confusing   too unfocused    unclear whose story phantom menace    original trilogy   movies were clearly luke story   stories centering around growth farmboy rebel hero jedi knight    unclear whether new film anakin story obi wan    trilogy centered anakin   shaky foundation    lloyd   like many child actors   lacks subtle acting skills adult performers   result

 though often iffy dialogue lucas    neeson perfect aging jedi knight    mcgregor cast obi wan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility    portman fits role young queen   lines were often very formal   giving little room character much personality    biggest problem phantom menace not plot characters   interaction between    individually   characters new film no less developed those original star wars   storyline not more confusing previous films series    unlike previous trilogy   lucas doesn t good job playing characters off another    star wars   were immediate contrasts

b horror films s s   become    however   learned  small budget horror sci fi film   sometimes expectations shattered    lot criticism has gone against film   read far   anyway  yep   reviews     makes wonder why types films automatically dismissed gory   laughable pieces trash      thing   isn t    made   acted   quite intelligent    critics complaining level gore level sexuality film    species series isn t lack elements    much film    yet   behind   has basic premise allows away doing    species ii begins present   though seems alternate universe    many films   especially sci fi ones

very handsome astronaut    patrick son senator ross   james cromwell     wants patrick succeed      seem has succeeded    landing surface mars   human being ever    course   isn t ever    billion

form creeps along floor inhabits earthlings    pass approximately seven minutes   shrug off nothing   t remember    blame technical malfunction    earth   patrick begins strong urges mate many women possible    know original   alien wants breed take planet    however   children bred half human   father    patrick really looking another alien breed   finds eve   natasha henstridge      eve cloned dna taken sil   original alien    however   time around     alien   urges been either decreased dramatically   lie dormant    project led dr   laura baker   marg helgenberger   reprising role species     motives seem respectable    since involved original alien attack   wants learn stop alien should again    has    story wise   species ii much stronger predecessor   much stronger     aliens   hey   love film   t tell strong story      surprised film incorporation historical facts screenplay    search extraterrestrial intelligence course college   learned piece rock mars landed poles    piece rock contained fossils may been proof life mars   later   proven not living creature created      script uses effectively   manages provide balanced plot    beginning man mars   something always dreamed seeing     hoping film turn element useful starting point movie    does quite    characters smart   know what not    character seems little cliched general   george dzundza     yet   remains logical everything does    obvious flaws course   mostly lying technical aspects    special effects mediocre   plain bad    part   remain believable   noticed homage alien series mothers gave birth alien children        realistic ones usually goriest   ranging people being torn open   someone head being blown off    however   plot elements may elicit laughs audience   including menage troi necessary    many people dislike species series is excuse sex   nudity   gory violence    however   tend disagree    were alien films      alien species ever did earth   sole purpose destroy   wouldn t mate quickly possible many people possible    gripe during scene where patrick goes searching mate grocery store    didn t realize aliens were picky choosing women mate   assume part human side looking beautiful      acting quite good kind film    vast improvement film   least    acting key element film   bad   lowered itself camp   good   asked comparison films like aliens    okay   isn t good    george dzundza probably obvious mistake casting   top impersonation general makes annoying distracting    natasha henstridge limited time around   usually enclosed cage    however   does manage very impressive performance aspect hindering talent    oh yeah   quite fun plain watch    marg helgenberger immensely better time around   performance probably best film    michael madsen so   isn t annoying   soon becomes rather appealing   nice cynic personality      james cromwell has small part   makes much better been more incapable actor      film james cromwell dramatically increases likeability    mykelti williamson gives enjoyable performance   gives film more down earth feel      course   justin lazard    lazard has far been ridiculed performance   effective    sure   wooden   isn t character like    moment touches glass separating henstridge extremely done   due couple acting    species ii rated r strong sexuality   sci fi violence gore language    definitely r rated film young kids should not    more likely   probably nightmares never sex rest lives    hell   don t know    sure critically lambasted film turns surprise film    probably won t another film where expecting little got much quite while    director peter medak has crafted very suspenseful   sometimes very scary movie mediocre series    medak has mastered wonderful   jump      moments   has
